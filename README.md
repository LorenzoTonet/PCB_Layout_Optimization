# PCB Layout Optimization via Multi-Objective GA

In this project, the main task is to optimize the position of components of different shape, dimension and with different pins layout in a rectangular pcb board of given dimension. The objective functions taken into account are
- Maximum temperature reached in the board
- Total distance between pins that needs to be collected
- Total area occupied by the board
